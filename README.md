A simple script to download all the photos that have been uploaded in commons.wikimedia.org during "WikiAcademy Kosovo 2013"

More info about Wiki Academy Kosovo: http://wikiacademykosovo.org


Note: Images uploaded to Commons using Flickr upload bot will not be sorted properly into folders. So far I've seen them being downloaded in "en" folder.
(I'lll try to fix this issue in the other version of the script)
